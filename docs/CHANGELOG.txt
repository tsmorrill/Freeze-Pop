2022-06-06: v0.2.0

 * Refactored most of the scripts and their naming conventions.
   - Removed all class definitions and rewrote most functions accordingly.
   - Removed passive voice from function names.
   - frzpop.generators is now frzpop.machines
   - frzpop.patterns is now frzpop.shuffle
   - frzpop.chords and frzpop.scales now both measure intervals between
     consecutive notes instead of always referencing the root.
   - frzpop.trigs is now subsumed into frzpop.machines
 * Added functions for direct freezing of phrases and sections.
 * Added ability to name the tracks of the output file.
 * Freezing a note still calls vel if vel is callable, but does not pass it the
   t counter.
 * Added "additives" submodule for organizing code shared between scripts.
   - p_gen decorator is now state_machine
   - state_machines do not accept any arguments
   - list_reader and rng are state machines available for all scripts
 * Added machines
   - attenuvert, automaton, clip, contour, interleave, is_over, offset, mix,
     pulse, ramp, saw, sine, skip, sweep
 * Running freezers.py as a script prints a list of its defined names. This is
   intended to facilitate making further changes to the import list in
   __init__.py.
 * Broke frzpop.stochastic, will remove in a future version.
 * Bugfixes.
