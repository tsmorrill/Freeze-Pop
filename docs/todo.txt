NEXT CHANGELOG:

 * split sine machine into sine_fixed and sine_free
 * new additives:
   - bogo
   - choose_from
   - gamut
 * renamed additives:
   - list_reader -> next_in
 * fixed guido
 * added count_vowels
 * removed frzpop.stochastic


LOOSE ITEMS:


 * develop automated tests using the dunder clause in freezers.py
 * check if each script should be importing more from additives
 * consider adding type hints and using mypy
 * consider using black
 * get a royalty free image of freezer pops
 * add note definitions for 19edo
 * fork into a liveplay project?
