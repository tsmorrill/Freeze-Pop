loose agenda:

 * develop automated tests using the dunder clause in freezers.py
 * check if each script should be importing more from additives
 * consider adding type hints and using mypy
 * consider using black
 * get a royalty free image of freezer pops
 * add note definitions for 19edo
 * fork into a liveplay project?

agenda by subdirectory and filename:

 * setup.cfg
   - add PyPI metadata

 * /examples/
   - update all examples to 0.1.4 compatibility
   - add new examples
     . passing tones quantization
     . polyrhythm
     . trap hi hat

 * /additives/
   - import Random
      . add to __init__.py

 * __init__.py
   - refactor import structure

 * chords.py
   - call gamut from additives
   - add ninth chords

 * dynamics.py

 * freezers.py
   - rename make_freezer -> freezer
     . this broke something last time
     . also rename make_cube -> cube
   - add ratchet freezer
   - add echo freezer
   - add conditional freezer
     . prob freezer is a kind of conditional freezer
     . maybe not...
   - consider adding a freezer decorator

 * machines.py
   - add sine_irrational
   - add grid machine, accepts controls "up", "down", "left", "right"
     . this is actually a different kind of thing than the machines. maybe a game?
   - bring back 2d heightmaps

 * shuffle.py
   - add rotate(phrase)
   - add random_walk, random_walk_2d
   - research method ringing techniques
     . plain bob minor
   - research FFT techniques
   - add tree-based pitch-to-rhythm assignment
   - process notes in decreasing order of stress?
      . ornamentation via tiered chord note/neighbor note/chromatic note generation
   - add more dithering patterns
      . context specific dithering

 * scales.py
   - call gamut from additives
   - add pentatonic scales
     . major
     . minor
     . Japanese
   - add "scale pairs"
     . harmonic minor
     . flamenco mode
     . name isn't right, find who came up with the generalization


 * stochastic.py
   - add count_vowels
   - finish guido refactor then move to machines.py

 * quantize.py
   - add second order quantizer, ie two different scales depending on change sign
