* freezers can input s and t, but notes and vels should be state machines
* get a royalty free image of freezer pops
* fork into a liveplay project?
* add note definitions for 19edo

===============================================================================

# setup.cfg
 - add PyPi metadata

* /examples/
 - update all examples to 0.1.4 compatibility
 - add new examples
  . passing tones quantization
  . polyrhythm
  . trap hi hat

* /additives/additives.py
 - add random_reader(list)
 - update the rest of the scripts to import state_machine and rng

* __init__.py
 - refactor import structure

* chords.py
 - add ninth chords

* dynamics.py

* freezers.py
 - rename make_freezer -> freezer
  . this broke something last time
  . also rename make_cube -> cube
 - add ratchet freezer
 - add echo freezer
 - add conditional freezer
  . prob freezer is a kind of conditional freezer
  . maybe not...
 - consider adding a freezer decorator

* machines.py
 - add grid machine, accepts controls "up", "down", "left", "right"
  . this is actually a different kind of thing than the machines. maybe a game?
 - bring back 2d heightmaps

* shuffle.py
 - add rotate(phrase)
 - add random_walk, random_walk_2d
 - research method ringing techniques
  . plain bob minor
 - research FFT techniques
 - add tree-based pitch-to-rhythm assignment
 - process notes in decreasing order of stress?
   . ornamentation via tiered chord note/neighbor note/chromatic note generation
 - add more dithering patterns
   . context specific dithering

* scales.py
 - add some more scales
  . try not to get carried away

 * stochastic.py
  - finish guido refactor then move to machines.py

* quantize.py
